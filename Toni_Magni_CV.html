				<h3>Cone beam computed tomography and the orthodontic office of the future</h3>
				<h4> March 2009</h4>
				<p>the use of technological devices has not always successfully increased the efficiency of orthodontic practices. often, new technology is introduced into the practice too soon, effectively interrupting the learning process of their older counterparts and hindering optimization. consequently, the ultimate goal of efficiency can easily become eclipsed by indulging into new orthodontic gadgets.cone beam computed tomography can similarly get in the way, if the users are not aware of such phenomena. in this article the author relates how these can negatively affect efficiency, while explaining the role of software interoperability for the ergonomics of the orthodontic practice. some suggestions on how to prepare for the future are provided.<br><a href= "" target= "_blank"></a></p>
				<h3>Solving incompatibilities between electronic records for orthodontic patients</h3>
				<h4> July 2007</h4>
				<p>Today, orthodontists should not need to burden their work load with tasks such as figuring out how to send patient information to colleagues or how to share the same patient record across different software programs. In a long-term attempt to lighten these tasks, we are developing a standard for electronic orthodontic patient records to enable a seamless interchange of data between software programs. This article describes a practical proposal that integrates 2 existing standards, HL7 and DICOM, to create a standard for electronic orthodontic patient records.<br><a href= "" target= "_blank"></a></p>

				Engineer Antonio Magni has been collaborating with our orthodontic practice as an IT expert for more than ten years now. He has always ensured the smooth functioning of our management software and the entire network infrastructure with great dedication and availability. Over these years, a relationship of friendship and mutual trust has developed between him and the members of the practice. This allows me to affirm that Antonio, or Toni as we call him, is a highly skilled IT professional and a friendly, reliable, punctual, and honest person. I can only wish him the best for the continuation of his professional career, hoping, although I have no doubts, that he will continue to come to our rescue with IT challenges in the future! Thank you, Toni, from all of us!
