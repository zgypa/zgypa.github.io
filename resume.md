## Standards Based

Being so adamant about informatics standards, i felt compelled to use a standard
for the CV, so i used the EuropassCV format. The PDF was generated from the
[europass European Union](https://europa.eu/europass/) website and it includes
the CV in Europass XML format. You can extract the XML with `pdfdetach`.
