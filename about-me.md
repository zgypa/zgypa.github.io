title: About Toni
---
Toni Magni is a biomedical engineer focused on orthodontic software IT infrastructures. Currently employed at tops Software (Atlanta, GA), he serves as co-chair of the ADA Standards Committee for Dental Informatics Working Group 11.6 (Integration of Orthodontic Standards) and Clinical Instructor in the Department of Orthodontics at Case Western Reserve University. He is fuelled by a passion for eliminating inefficiencies in the medical field, where software often makes exchanging data unnecessary difficult. To that end, Magni promotes interoperability in orthodontic practices by installing DICOM imaging servers and integrating them with existing software. Further, as a frequent collaborator with several associations and organizations, he has developed Python and JAVA tools to save and share orthodontic photographs and x-rays. Reflecting his belief that changes in informatics will best come through collaboration, these are available to the community on Github.com. 

Toni is eager to help create an infrastructure that software developers, doctors, and patients can use to fully take advantage of current and future technologies. To him, promoting interoperability is a multi-faceted affair; it requires work on multiple levels, with an eye towards a broader aim. As instructor and collabotor with others, he believes that the necessary changes to medical informatics will best occur from the ground-up: as a necessary, shared venture. In his capacity as co-chair of the Dental Informatics Working Group-and in collaboration with other professional organizations-he's also involved in envisioning policies that promote and protect interoperability in the field.  

A patient, hard-working self-described "nerd," Toni is a strong believer in mindfulness in the workspace. This is reflected in his deep interest in and frequent practice of meditation. Toni is always interested in collaborating with others, since his projects are often too big for him to complete alone.
