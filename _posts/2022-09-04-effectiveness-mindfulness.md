## Introduction 

These are my thoughts after having read [Defining and measuring meditation-related adverse effects in mindfulness-based programs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8845498/#!po=1.74419).

In the study, the authors are testing three types of mindfulness based meditations (open monitoring, focused attention, and standard MBCT), which i am personally not familiar with. The key points i will focus on, are these:

1. _The current study is an attempt to bring MBP harms monitoring up to the standards of other treatments so that providers can identify events that require monitoring and intervention in order to maximize the safety and efficacy of MBPs._
2. _The target sample was intended to represent Americans seeking mindfulness meditation training for the management or alleviation of clinical, sub-clinical and transdiagnostic expressions of affective disturbances, including anxiety, depression and stress._ It is worthwhile noting that the study has properly excluded those patients with conditions that the tested mindfulness methods considered not be adequate.
3. _All treatments met for three hours once per week for eight weeks, with a full-day silent retreat during week seven. Prescribed formal meditation practice homework was 45 min/day, six days/week, with additional informal practice as needed. Participants received basic training in targeted practices (FA, OM, or the combination in MBCT) during weeks 1–4 and then learned how to apply these practices to regulate negative emotions in weeks 5–8._
4. _The current study found that the active ingredient in MBPs, mindfulness meditation practice—including focused attention and open-monitoring practices alone or in combination—was associated with both transient distress and enduring negative impacts on life and functioning at similar rates to other psychological treatments._


## My thoughts

### 1: Reason for the study

I do agree that there is a need for making sure that Mindfulness Based Practices are properly assessed, and i have in the past proposed similar thinking for other practices which might be considered as esoteric by some. For example, practices i have encounterd which make use of testing muscle strengths in order to measure something going on in the body (immune system, allergies, healing, ...), the practitioner is the one applying force and measuring resistance with their own body, making absolutely no use of any kind of device to help them measure objectively. Even though many such devices would be relatively low cost: a simple spring could be used.

### 2: The target

I personally do not think that learning a mindfulness way of thinking for the above mentioned reasons to be sustainable: at the very least, when one seeks mindfulness to heal from something, they will be very tempted to quit practicing as soon as the healing improves, and only work when the suffering is highest.

I believe this to be a problem because the training of mindfulness requires a balanced mind, which is a lot harder to achieve when one is in a state of higher stress or suffering. Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that very little progress can be expected in these situations.

Clearly, the alleviation of clinical, sub-clinical and transdiagnositic expression of affective disturbances including anxiety, depression and stress will inevitable be reduced when the brain is properly being used in a mindful way.

I am not surprised to see adverse effects, or no improvement whatsoever, unless for some reason or another, the patient is somehow "talented" and has a natural or innate inclination to already use the brain in a mindful way.

I think that a mindful way of living entails using the brain in a completely different way with respect to the conventional, more popular, way we are used to using it, which is based on seeking pleasant sensations as a way to reduce suffering. The mindful person reduces suffering with awareness without judgement (by being aware of him/her self, by being aware of their suffering, by being aware of their surroundings and of all the sensations that appear and disappear. And by doing so simply accepting it as a reality, as a fact, without judgement).

As you can probably see, these are fundamentally two very different ways of using the brain. This is because both the mindful and the non-mindful person both live their life with the same common goal: to reduce suffering. Which means that both their brains spend their entire decision-making time thinking of the best solution to suffer less. Both consciously and unconsciously. Every time there is a decision to make, both you and i and everyone else  use our past experiences to help us make the decision which we believe will result in the least amount of suffering.
