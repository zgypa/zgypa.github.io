## Introduction 

These are my thoughts after having read [Defining and measuring meditation-related adverse effects in mindfulness-based programs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8845498/#!po=1.74419).

In the study, the authors are testing three types of mindfulness based meditations (open monitoring, focused attention, and standard MBCT), which i am personally not familiar with. The key points i will focus on, are these:

1. _The current study is an attempt to bring MBP harms monitoring up to the standards of other treatments so that providers can identify events that require monitoring and intervention in order to maximize the safety and efficacy of MBPs._
2. _The target sample was intended to represent Americans seeking mindfulness meditation training for the management or alleviation of clinical, sub-clinical and transdiagnostic expressions of affective disturbances, including anxiety, depression and stress._ It is worthwhile noting that the study has properly excluded those patients with conditions that the tested mindfulness methods considered not be adequate.
3. _All treatments met for three hours once per week for eight weeks, with a full-day silent retreat during week seven. Prescribed formal meditation practice homework was 45 min/day, six days/week, with additional informal practice as needed. Participants received basic training in targeted practices (FA, OM, or the combination in MBCT) during weeks 1–4 and then learned how to apply these practices to regulate negative emotions in weeks 5–8._
4. _The current study found that the active ingredient in MBPs, mindfulness meditation practice—including focused attention and open-monitoring practices alone or in combination—was associated with both transient distress and enduring negative impacts on life and functioning at similar rates to other psychological treatments._


## My thoughts

I think that a mindful way of living entails using the brain in a completely different way with respect to the conventional, more popular, way we are used to using it, which is based on seeking pleasant sensations as a way to reduce suffering. The mindful person reduces suffering with awareness without judgement (by being aware of him/her self, by being aware of their suffering, by being aware of their surroundings and of all the sensations that appear and disappear. And by doing so simply accepting it as a reality, as a fact, without judgement).

As you can probably see, these are fundamentally two very different ways of using the brain. This is because both the mindful and the non-mindful person both live their life with the same common goal: to reduce suffering. Which means that both their brains spend their entire decision-making time thinking of the best solution to suffer less. Both consciously and unconsciously. Every time there is a decision to make, both you and i and everyone else  use our past experiences to help us make the decision which we believe will result in the least amount of suffering.

### 1: Reason for the study

I do agree that there is a need for making sure that Mindfulness Based Practices
are properly assessed, and i have in the past proposed similar thinking for
other practices which might be considered as esoteric by some. For example,
practices i have encountered which make use of testing muscle strengths in order
to measure something going on in the body (immune system, allergies, healing,
...), the practitioner is the one applying force and measuring resistance with
their own body, making absolutely no use of any kind of device to help them
measure objectively. Even though many such devices would be relatively low cost:
a simple spring could be used.

### 2: The target

I personally do not think that learning a mindfulness way of thinking for the above mentioned reasons to be sustainable: at the very least, when one seeks mindfulness to heal from something, they will be very tempted to quit practicing as soon as the healing improves, and only work when the suffering is highest.

I believe this to be a problem because the training of mindfulness (which is no different than any other skill) requires a balanced mind, which is a lot harder to achieve when one is in a state of higher stress or suffering. Therefore it very little progress can be expected in these situations.

The alleviation of clinical, sub-clinical and transdiagnositic expression of affective disturbances including anxiety, depression and stress will inevitable be reduced when the brain is properly being used in a mindful way. The problem lies in learning how to use the brain in a mindful way. By definition, when the mind is in a mindful state, it cannot be depressed. A depressed mind cannot be in a mindful state. Learning how to achieve that state is the hard part.

### 3: Treatment application

The treatments were performed very similar to any other medical or physical
treatment: once per week with instructor, then every day exercise for 45
minutes. This kind of method has proven to work well for learning those skills
which require improving the performance of something we already know.

For example, if somebody would like to become more fit or regain control of a
limb, they can go to the Gym and work with a therapist once or twice a week, then
do their exercises at home every day. They will see positive results, that
works, because the patient already knows how to move the body in the correct
way. The exercise will only show them how to correct the way they move their
body.

But when we want to learn something completely new, we usually go all-the-way
full-immersion full-time for some time. For example, to become a doctor, one
obtains best results when one studies as a young person full time 8-12h per day,
at a University,  where the life is basically surrounded by learning medicine.
Even more so during residency, to really pick up the completely different life
style/work environment of the hospital. 

When we need to re-learn how to use something we are already using, especially
when it is something basic, fundamental to daily operations, it takes a great
deal of effort. A drummer playing traditionally needs to train very hard for at
least a year to learn how to play
[open-handed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-handed_drumming). When doing
so, she will most likely be pausing concerts and rehearsals during that time. A
computer programmer who wants to improve his or her typing by learning how to
type with an alternative more efficient keyboard layout (like
[Dvorak](https://dvorak-keyboard.com/) or
[Charachorder](https://www.charachorder.com/)) will have to pause and fully
immerse for period of time, before being able to benefit from it. It would be
unreasonable to expect the drummer to learn how play open-handed if they were to
keep playing their concerts and rehearsals cross-handed and then only spend 3%
of their drumming time per day (about 7 minutes per day, considering an average
of 4h per day playing time) practicing open-handed.

If 3% of the time might seem an exaggeratedly small amount, consider how much
the patient uses the brain traditionally, and how much the patient is expecting
results by using it mindfully (or trying to do so) for 45 minutes per day. The
patient uses the brain 24h per day, even in sleep, the brain keeps rolling, and
it keeps doing so the way it knows how to do so, certainly not mindfully. Then
these 45 minutes are like the 7 minutes of the drummer above. 

But not even that. At least the drummer above has an idea of what it is like to
play open-handed: they just have to practice it in order for it to become second
nature. The drummer could not expect any progress if he or she had really not
quite grasped what it meant to play open-handed. Just like you reading this
article right now, could make no progress in becoming an open-handed drummer
without knowing what i am writing about, or even having read the Wikipedia
article about it that i linked above. In the case of developing a new skill like
playing the drums open-handed, it is fairly easy to understand the theory, and
try it out a little bit to understand the benefits and the potential. But it is
a quite different thing, often much harder, when it comes to using the brain.

In the case of re-learning how to operate the brain, the patient, needs to reach
a point where they actually understand for the first time what it means for the
mind to be in a mindful state, and to understand how to get it there. This is an
essential milestone and breakthrough moment, which, until the patient is not
capable of grasping that concept, will not allow the patient to train for this
skill to become second nature.

Do you see where i'm trying to go with this? Expecting progress with only 45
minutes per day and three hours per week with an instructor is asking too much
from a person. And especially one that is only there with the expectation to
heal from something (as described in 2 above).

### 4: Results similar to other treatments

Mindfulness should be used as a way of living, not as a therapy for healing. It
should therefore not substitute other methods for healing, and it should not be
mixed with that. Confusing mindfulness as a tool for healing could very easily
lead to aversion towards the practice of mindfulness, because the patient will
not see any effects coming.
 
The path of mindfulness is a path towards a state without any craving or
aversion. If the patient is craving for healing, the patient is running in the
opposite direction of mindfulness and will develop aversion for it. One can
therefore expect the patient to regress, or to worsen his or her condition. I am
therefore not surprised to see adverse effects, or no improvement whatsoever in
this study. Actually, i would expect results to fall in the following categories:

1. Positive progress can be expected for those individuals who are somehow
"talented" or have natural or innate inclination to already use the brain in a
mindful way. When they are able to keep the mind in that state, progress is
expected. 
2. Some neutral or positive progress is to be expected when the mind is in a
state of light distraction taking a break from life. It can provide the same
benefit than a 45 minute nap could, or a 45 minute warm bath, or a 45 minute
massage. When the mind is stopping the intake of new information and taking time
off for one self, stopping to digest, the mind can benefit.
3. Negative progress is to be expected when the mind is in a state of craving
and aversion. And if this exercise is done with the expectation of healing, than
craving and aversion are bound to increase. When the mind rolls in craving and
aversion, increase of suffering is expected.

Each individual will have their mind in a mixture of these states (and maybe others as well), depending on their skills and experiences. For most individuals, the easiest place for the mind to go into, is in the third state, the state of craving and aversion, because that is how we constantly use our minds all of the time.

## Final Thoughts

In my opinion, in order to see results, the individual needs to:

1. Understand what it means for the mind to be mindful. In order for this to happen, it is very useful to attend 10-day retreats during which the student has nothing else to do with their mind but to work on mindfulness. Only mindfulness, 24h/day. 
2. The individual needs to have a very strong determination, because this path is very hard, and requires a lot of effort. The main drive cannot be, therefore, to simply heal whatever illness or disturbance they might have. Eventually the disturbances will go away, but this is a side-effect. If the individual is solely driven by their disturbance, they will not have motivation to work during the time when the disturbance is at its lowest, and they will not have a clear and open mind to be able to make progress when their disturbance is at its highest.
3. A wise mindfulness teacher will refuse to take up a student if the student is not determined to come out of their misery eradicating their suffering from the roots regardless of their physical or mental condition. Mindfulness is a strange state of mind in which things happen in a way that is not immediately intuitive. For example, we cannot crave for progress. We can only accept a lack of progress, or a presence of it. We cannot force ourselves to work harder and expect progress. This works when developing other skills, but not with mindfulness. With mindfulness we can only work as hard as we can, before it becomes suffering. We do not torture ourselves. And we need to work enough so that we don't feel guilty for not having worked enough. We must find the proper balance, the right way. That's what mindfulness is about.
