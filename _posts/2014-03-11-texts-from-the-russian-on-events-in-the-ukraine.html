<p>http://elzizi.brillig.org/texts-from-the-russian-on-events-in-the-ukraine/</p>


<p>Below are links to texts translated by myself from the Russian, all related to events in Ukraine.  I hope to expand the list with time.  </p>

<p>The purpose of these texts is to bring forward voices - well-articulated voices, voices that strike me as reasonable and easy to empathize with, from within the experience of being a thinking, conscious, citizen of Ukraine or Russia at this moment. </p>

<p>They represent narratives, attitudes and perspectives that are not very well reflected in the coverage of this deeply traumatic period in the Western press.  They also represent a sort of dialogue among like-minded people across this terribly artificial divide. </p>

(March 10, 2014)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These texts combine outrage and hope and tongue-in-cheekness and even, remarkably, some humor. </p>

<p>But it should be clear that what is happening is so unspeakably horrible to the thinking, conscious, empathetic people of Russia and Ukraine.  </p>

<p>It is the inconceivable horror of civil war that is so far beyond words, and that is the pain that is the undertow in everything.  The war with the self, with the brother, the eating of your own soul.   </p>

<p>The following interview is not of a pundit or writer or journalist or poet, but, randomly, of a professional athlete - Aleksandr Shovkovski. He is the goalkeeper of Kiev's premier football team Dynamo.  He tries to respond to a question about the current situation in Ukraine (it is worth noting with an absolutely lovely, highly articulate Russian diction) until he cannot respond.  </p>

<p>In that he speaks for so many people.  </p>

<p>Indeed, any affected person he is not speaking for is not worth speaking for. </p>

<p>Watch it even if you do not understand.  The full translation is below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know, I really don't want to comment with respect to the political situation in our country.  But the extremeness of the events occurring here, cannot leave any person who lives here ambivalent.  I remember my grandfather, who always ... when lifting his first glass would pronounce a toast: may there never be War.  We ... that, has remained ... had remained in my heart &lt;<em>eyes well with tears</em>&gt; ... excuse me &lt;<em>turns away</em>&gt;.

<p>ps. Thank you to Dr. Yevgeni Gayev in Kiev for sending several of these texts to me.</p>

The texts speak for themselves, that is, the writers speak for themselves.  But to understand why I am posting them, some background is helpful.  

I am an American, raised mostly in Cleveland, Ohio, who is very fortunate to speak, read and understand Russian fluently. My parents are from Kharkov, a mostly Russian speaking city in northeastern Ukraine (and, consequently, a flashpoint of ongoing unrest).  My parents left in the 1970's and, like many of their generation and milieu, have never - and to this day - felt themselves to be particularly "Ukrainian" - that was a distinction of no meaning in Soviet times.  

Ethnicity also meant relatively little to them, and means close to nothing to me now, though that was a much more important distinction in a country that stamped "nationality" (including, for example, "Jewish") into every passport.  For what it is worth, I am proximally (i.e. to the third generation) a mix of Jewish, Ukrainian, and Azerbaijani, i.e. no Russian "blood" to speak of.  I was, and remain, a well-adjusted Soviet mutt, just as every one of my American friends is a mutt, all fairly brimming with hybrid vigor.  

We were raised speaking, reading, writing, eating, joking Russian.  So that, more or less, was our immigrant identity. My parents are very well educated, very well read, very funny, in their own ways, and very worldly.   

And as I've grown up I find myself doing very many ridiculously "Russian" things, with great pleasure and with various degrees of advanced mediocrity (e.g. playing the piano, playing chess, picking mushrooms, doing math, drinking vodka only with a toast and a zakuska, cross-country skiing, sweating heavily in banyas, occasionally enjoying the ballet, and very occasionally reading a very long book).  

More importantly, my profession as a quantitative wildlife ecologist has given me the opportunity to be in and work in 



One of the most touching
