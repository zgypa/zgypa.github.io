A pretty ambitious goal at [Factom](http://www.factom.com/): to create software that makes it impossible to change the past and point that software at places where it solves valuable business problems. Basically create software that is impossible to hack. Impossible it a big word, and i like ambitious projects!

Factom works with blockchains.

Factom has been [backed by Gates Foundation](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/gates-foundation-grant-boosts-factom-s-blockchain-based-medical-record-development-1479492383) for blockchain based medical records.

I believe that blockchain based medical records will be the technology behind the first generation of complete fully and internationally integrated medical records.
