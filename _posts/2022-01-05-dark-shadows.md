* Johnny Depp, Eva Green, etc..
* Tim Burton
* Movie about vampires.
* Seen in English, on TV, with Lisy in Arezzo, Italy, while she was checking out the city to possibly work there.
* Pleasant portrayal of a vampire as it interacts with everyday life. The contrast between everyday life and black magic, witchcraft, and the world of the vampires is brought to the forefront, asking the qestion, how would a witch and a vampire actually "live" and interact with society?
* I enjoyed the outfit, costume and the haircut, specifically of Johnny Depp.
* I have not seen it until the end, but i read the Wikipedia plot. I found the plot also relatively entertaining.
* It's interesting how the witch and the vampire are portrayed as being so attached to mundane pleasures, like money and sex. One would think that once one has lived so long, or has been around for so long, one would transcend worldly pleasures.
* The vampire has somewhat moral principles, which are advantageous for the audience, as these are shown as something to look up to. For example: 
  * the vampire saves the kid from death, at the cost of giving up his real nature. 
  * the vampire says "no" to the witches' temptations, at the cost of being locked back up in a casket for centuries.
  * the vampire gives the unworthy, passive father a chance to either take up his role as a real father, or take some family money and leave.
* Tim Burton also did a good job in picking fake blood that obviously doesn't look real; it's way too bright and looks more like cartoon blood. This lightens the dreadful weight of the vampire's terrible actions and killing of so many people.
* Rating of this movie: 3.5 or maybe 4? A somewhat healthy message, with some good acting and good costumes and imageries.
