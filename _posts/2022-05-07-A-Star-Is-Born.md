* Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper.
* Movie about musicians: one is famous, the other not yet. But they fall in love and he brings her to fame thanks to his fame.
* Seen on AZ608 ROM-JFK
* Movie about alcoohol addicts and where alcoohol and drugs take you.
* Want to read more about this movie: didn't know they were real musicians, didn't know she was Lady Gaga.
* Long movie, more than 2h.
* The music is good, and one can clearly see it's not playback. This does make a huge difference in the way the movie feels. It just feels so much more real and natural.
* At times i felt like fast farwarding: too stereotypical. But the message is sound. Great movie for teenagers. I can see how a teenager might fall deeply for it, or as i might have as teenager.
